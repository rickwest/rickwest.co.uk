I am Rick West. Hi ðŸ‘‹. 

I am a web developer, currently working at a local ecommerce company, and also currently studying Software Engineering at Sheffield Hallam University, as part of a Degree Apprenticeship. 

I work primarily with PHP and the Symfony framework, as well as Javascript along with React and Redux.

I'm really passionate about learning and developing my skill-set and enjoy spending some free time keeping up to date with the latest industry news or tinkering on a side project.

I enjoy writing (here and on Medium), and try to inspire, encourage and immerse myself in the web development community where I can.

I made the transition in to tech following a 12 year career as a Plumbing and Heating Engineer and remain a qualified Gas Engineer ðŸ”§!

Outside of work and coding, I enjoy boxing (watching from the comfort of my armchair),Â Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead but especially spending time with my wife, son and daughter. Family is everything.

You can keep in touch with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rick_west8), [Medium](https://medium.com/@rickwest8) or by signing up for my [Newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/rickwest).
