excerpt: Business vs Developer ðŸ¥Š. When it comes to starting a new project, what is the right approach?

My company is starting on the build of a potential new SaaS product and Iâ€™ve been given the job of building out a Minimum Viable Product.

Iâ€™m excited, because itâ€™s the first real project that Iâ€™ve been given ownership of and it really has the potential to be a long term success. Itâ€™s a great milestone in my new career.

However, weâ€™re only a small company and there has been a bit of debate in the office this week about choosing the development â€˜stackâ€™ we should work with and how we should approach building the MVP.

One side of the argument is the â€˜businessâ€™ side â€”

>This is just an MVP, lets build something as quickly as possible to get it out and start getting some user feedback. Weâ€™ll worry about the build later. If it gets some interest we can alwayâ€™s rebuild in the future.

In contrast to that, you have the argument of the senior developer â€”

>Lets build it right from the start. A solid platform to expand upon instead of something that needs rebuilding if it takes off!
He doesnâ€™t just want to bodge something together. He wants to architect it correctly and start with a solid foundation.

As a junior developer, Iâ€™ve not been asked for too much input. Iâ€™ve just sat back and watched with interest. My opinion sitâ€™s somewhere in the middle. Part of me does think we need to start out as we mean to go on. I donâ€™t want to spend the next 3â€“6 months working on something, only to have to rewrite it from the ground up again.

On the other hand, I donâ€™t want to over engineer something and spend the coming monthâ€™s building something that ultimately ends up going nowhere.

That begs the questionâ€Šâ€”â€ŠIs there a balance somewhere in the middle? Can we build something solid, but maybe with a smaller subset of the important features? Can we use technologies that are more flexible, that allow us to start small and easily scale later down the line? Can we use a subset of the technology â€˜stackâ€™ that the senior developer wants to use, instead of throwing everything at it from the start?

Iâ€™m sure that at a bigger company, there will be a process, a blueprint set out for building an MVP. But at a small startup, the only blueprint we have is opinion.

Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that maybe we are simply over thinking it. Maybe the most important thing is to just get started now, with what is appropriate for what we need, now.

Maybe itâ€™s best to just let it grow organically over time. Surely the most important thing is to just to start building. If Mark Zuckerberg had started out building Facebook, with the plan it was going to be as big as it is today, would we even have Facebook?

I wonder, does ignorance, passion and determination spawn the best product rather than having â€˜the perfect technology stackâ€™. Thatâ€™s something that I will definitely look into further.

Either way, Iâ€™m looking forward to starting building, itâ€™s going to be an interesting few months! Please share your insight and opinion in the comments below!
