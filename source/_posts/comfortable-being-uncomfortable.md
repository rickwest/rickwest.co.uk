excerpt: When you feel uncomfortable, it means you‚Äôre moving forward and exploring new territory. So, does that mean being uncomfortable can actually be a good thing? ü§î

Learning how to be comfortable being uncomfortable is possibly one of the most important lessons that I have learned whilst on my journey as a newbie Web Developer.

As I‚Äôm writing this, I‚Äôm sitting on a train on my way to London. It‚Äôs the Legal Software Suppliers Association‚Äôs 21st birthday dinner or something like that. As members, the company I work for have been invited to the event. The dinner is being held at the top of London‚Äôs iconic BT Tower. (*That meant nothing to me either, but apparently it‚Äôs supposed to be quite a big deal!*)

If I‚Äôm honest, I‚Äôm absolutely dreading it. That might sound bizarre. Who wouldn‚Äôt enjoy a swanky free dinner at a restaurant thats not even open to the public! Me‚Ä¶go on, call me stupid.

I‚Äôve spent the last 10 years as a plumber. Nothing could be any further from the black tie event that I‚Äôm on my way to! It makes me feel uncomfortable, it‚Äôs out of my comfort zone!

It may just be my personality, but I‚Äôm sure other people feel the same in certain situations and can relate. Sometimes, certain things just make you feel uncomfortable.

If it wasn‚Äôt for my wife, I would probably just have made my excuses and stayed at home. It‚Äôs only natural to avoid putting yourself in situations where you feel uncomfortable. It‚Äôs human nature. The problem is, as my wife pointed out, that by always doing this, you never get any further in life.

##To improve your skills, make life changing connections and smash your goals, you have to get comfortable being uncomfortable.

Ever since I started learning web development, and especially since getting my first job, being uncomfortable has become a recurring theme.

As a new or aspiring web developer, it‚Äôs just something you have to get used to. However, once you embrace that horrible feeling of being out of your comfort zone, you will be astounded by the progress that you will make, both with your coding skill and also personally. It is unbelievable!

Maybe you have been learning to code for a while but still don‚Äôt feel confident enough to apply for junior developer jobs. You might not feel you are ready yet. You might fear rejection. Ultimately, a lack of self confidence will make you feel uncomfortable. And you‚Äôre not alone. We would all feel the same in that situation. However, it‚Äôs the people who suck it up, apply for every job they can, contact companies asking for work, and face potential rejection after rejection who will win.

Hell, you might not be ready yet and you might not land your dream job straight away. But, by putting yourself out there. By stepping out of your comfort zone, you win. You win! You get the interview practice, the experience and you get vital feedback on where you need to improve.

At the end of the day, would you rather be someone who has been learning to code for 18 months, but hasn‚Äôt even started applying for jobs, because you don‚Äôt feel comfortable or ready yet?

Or would you rather be the person who‚Äôs been learning to code for 6 months, and starts applying for jobs. You might feel uncomfortable and maybe it takes you another 6 months to land a job, but 12 months after first opening a text editor and you are working in your dream career? Believe me, this can happen. You just need to get comfortable being uncomfortable.

##That uncomfortable feeling doesn‚Äôt stop once you get your first job.

I got hired as a junior PHP developer, but the main product at the company I work at, is a SaaS app with a React UI.

I must have spent the first 6 months at my job convincing myself that I didn‚Äôt need to be very good at Javascript because I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do front-end‚Äù. How naive was I! How ridiculous!

I‚Äôm a fairly confident Junior PHP developer, but I passed on several opportunities to work on our UI just so I didn‚Äôt have to put myself in that uncomfortable situation where you don‚Äôt really know what your doing and you end up having to reach for the documentation every 30 seconds. It wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt want to learn React or improve my Javascript skills. It was just because I was more ‚Äòcomfortable‚Äô working on our backend! But, thats what web development is. You will never know everything and will always be faced with situations where you are made to feel uncomfortable doing something you haven‚Äôt done before. That‚Äôs the price of progression. That‚Äôs what you need to get used to as a Junior.

Actually, once I got comfortable being uncomfortable, I realised that I actually enjoy React. Who would have thought it ey!

I have learned a valuable new skill, improved my employability, increased the value of my skill set and maybe now I can go as far as to call myself a ‚Äòfull stack developer‚Äô!‚Ä¶Ok, that might be pushing it!

##This may all sound easy, but I still have to remind myself to take my own advice!

Nearly a year into working, as a Web Developer, and I still feel uncomfortable at times, but I am getting better and better at feeling comfortable being uncomfortable!

Meet-ups have always interested me since starting my Web Development journey. I‚Äôve read great things, and really do think that spending time around like minded individuals can help accelerate your learning and progression. Unfortunately though, I‚Äôm just not a social butterfly. I like to keep myself to myself and spending time on my own really isn‚Äôt a problem!

I get self conscious, worried about having less knowledge than other developers, and just the whole imposter syndrome in general kicks in. Sometimes its hard for me to try and explain to people why I gave up a solid, well-payed career like plumbing to learn something totally new at nearly 30. Those of you who have done it, are doing it or have just thought about it will know though! And when you know you know!

Anyway, to cut a long story short. I still haven‚Äôt been to a conference or Meet-up. But, in the next few months I am going to take the plunge and book tickets to this year‚Äôs Symfony Live London, PHP North West Conference and hopefully get to a local meet-up. It‚Äôs time for me to take my own advice and make another step forward in my career as a Web Developer.

**Life WILL make you feel uncomfortable, but don‚Äôt ever let it stop you. You have to remember, it‚Äôs a good thing to feel uncomfortable. When you feel uncomfortable, it means you‚Äôre moving forward and exploring new territory. Get comfortable being uncomfortable and find out how far this journey can take you!**
