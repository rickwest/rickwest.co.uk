title: Add Flash to Chromium on Ubuntu 16.04

I like to listen to music at work, and with Amazon Prime Music I have plenty of music easily accessible. Unless Linux is your operating system of choice, that is. Although there is no native Linux app, there is an Amazon Music web app. Great. Apart from it needs flash installed. 

No problem. 

However, not as straight forward as it sounds. There's no official Flash extension for Chromium. 

A little search on Google and I discovered lots of references to outdated packages and old tutorials. I tried a few of the options and found either the packages no longer existed or they were for older versions of Ubuntu. 

In the end, I managed to get it sorted really easily, after stumbling across [Jonathon F's](https://launchpad.net/~jonathonf/+archive/ubuntu/pepperflashplugin-nonfree) back-port of pepperflashplug<wbr></wbr>in-nonfree with direct download of Flash from Adobe instead of using Chrome RPM. So to save my future self and anyone else the pain...

### Add the new pepperflashplugin-nonfree

Open a terminal and add the PPA 
```shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/pepperflashplugin-nonfree
```

Update your package list's to make sure you are getting the latest version 
```shell
sudo apt update
```

Install the package 
```shell
sudo apt install pepperflashplugin-nonfree
```

It's that easy! After running the install command, close all chromium windows and if you go to `chrome://flash/` in your browser you should see the flash plugin installed ðŸ™‚ 

When a new version of Flash is released, update by doing 
```shell
sudo update-pepperflashplugin-nonfree --install
```

Un-install the package 
```shell
sudo apt remove pepperflashplugin-nonfree browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash
```

```shell
sudo apt autoremove
```

Hope that helped! I know I will probably be revisiting this page again sometime in the future!
