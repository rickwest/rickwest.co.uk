We’ve all been there. Learning to code, completing tutorial after tutorial, but getting nowhere. Then the self doubt kicks in. “This is too hard.” Or “maybe coding isn’t for me.” I’m sure you know the feeling.

I experienced this very same problem myself recently. I’m a fairly confident junior PHP developer, but I decided that I wanted to learn a little more about Python — especially Django.

I searched online and found what looked like the perfect tutorial. Complex enough to be challenging, but simple enough so as not to overwhelm.

Being a project based tutorial, I liked the look of the end project. I thought it would be another cool thing to add to my ever growing portfolio.

80% of the way into this tutorial, I suddenly <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="c74f7098e40e">had a spell of self dou</span>bt. I had <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="6533e0f10a9c">watched</span> the videos and manually retyped all the code. I had a neat project that I could show people. So why did I feel like I was no better off than when I had started?

<span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="209cff27bd9e">A</span>fter several weeks of spending my evenings working through a tutorial I had a nice finished project. Even then, I still didn’t feel like I had the skills to replicate this project myself <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="209cff27bd9e">w</span>ithout guidance. So could I really use it in my portfolio?

Was it really that impressive to have a portfolio project that looked and functioned identically to everyone else’s? And which had code that was identical to the code on the instructor’s GitHub profile?

<span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="bd02f27bcee0">Had I really showcased any of my skills other than my ability to follow step-by-step instructions?</span>

You see, following tutorials is great. You’ll get exposure to new skills. <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="432279a9a2f3">But</span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="432279a9a2f3 bd02f27bcee0">just following tutorials alone, you don’t learn any of the other skills that are required</span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="432279a9a2f3"> to be a successful junior developer. I’m talking about:</span>

- <span class="markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="74a62b732b57">planning and organizing a project</span>
- <span class="markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="74a62b732b57">knowing what tools are best for</span> <span class="markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="74a62b732b57">a given business need</span>
- <span class="markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="74a62b732b57">researching solutions to your own problems</span>
- <span class="markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="74a62b732b57">overcoming problems that inevitably crop up during development</span>

### Tutorials are a good way to hit the ground running.

To put things in context, <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="6989076ed0b5">I’m a 29-year-old former plumber who now works as a junior developer for a software company</span>. I decided on a career change around 12 months ago.

Like <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="f4145549d168">most</span> new coders, I started completing the usual courses before moving onto more advanced tutorials. My main focus was on learning PHP (this was the only language that I’d really heard of when I started.) Soon I became familiar with its basic syntax and use.

Fast forward 9 months. I had completed enough tutorials, had enough understanding, and enough motivation to convince a local software company to give me an opportunity. (You can read more about how I convinced an employer to [take a chance on me and pay me to learn to code here](http://rickwest.co.uk/first-web-development-job).)

At the end of the day, <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="af24346eefc1">what helped me stand out as a candidate and get a job after such a short time was my ability to show real world examples of projects that I had built. And when I say projects, I mean my OWN projects…not just things that I had copied/pasted following along with a tutorial.</span>

### <span class="markup--quote markup--h3-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="1fded72e3d10 480d7742ed63">Tutorials will only get you so far. Then you need to start building projects.</span>

</div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">Don’t get me wrong — tutorials are great. Especially for beginners who are learning the fundamentals. Of course, the quality of tutorials and level of explanation will differ greatly. <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="f5ebd9694a18">But </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="f5ebd9694a18 c94521d063df">going through tutorial after tutorial will not on its own turn you into an expert.</span>

<span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="b0326a4269d8">Well, no one is expecting you to build the next big thing. And you probably don’t have the skills to do so, even if you did have the idea.</span>

You can also build something like a blog, for example. Yes, there are thousands of tutorials based around building a blog. You might even have copied and pasted the code to one before. This might not seem like an impressive project but…

### Build projects and reap the benefits.

Build your OWN blog. Sit down, plan the different steps and features it will have before you start. Research and choose the languages and framework you are going to use. Figure out how to install the necessary tools and set up your development environment yourself. When you get stuck on a problem or feature, turn to Google and investigate the best way to overcome the problem you are faced with.

Do this and you will learn 10x more than following any tutorial. Do this, and this one project will be worth more than the 20 tutorial projects that you might have in your portfolio.

Depending on the complexity of your chosen project, you might not even need anything else in your portfolio in order to start applying for jobs. <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="6ad26261ea08 f5ebd9694a18">Your code might not be the best, but it is YOUR code</span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="f5ebd9694a18">.</span> You can explain every line of it, and explain how and why you came to make the decisions that you have.

<span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="fce6e1034b1f">You will also have proved that you can manage a project, work independently, learn new skills as needed, and deliver an end product. Now you have several valuable skills to offer a potential employer.</span>

<span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="2ea60bea0a8c bee33e964a63">If you’re 12, 18 months into learning, and haven’t found a job or don’t feel that you are anywhere near ready, then don’t get disheartened</span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="bee33e964a63">. Don’t give up. Don’t start thinking that you need to spend thousands of dollars on a “magic” bootcamp. </span><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="bee33e964a63 66a89a28755e">Just start building things and you’ll be amazed with how quickly you can progress!</span>
