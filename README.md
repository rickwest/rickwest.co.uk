My personal website. Sporadic thoughts about life and code ðŸ“š https://www.rickwest.co.uk/

Based on my [Jigsaw Clean Blog starter](https://github.com/rickwest/jigsaw-clean-blog), a simple [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/) implementation of the [Startbootstrap Clean Blog theme](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/).  

Please, [give the starter a try](https://github.com/rickwest/jigsaw-clean-blog) and build your own site! If you do...don't forget to drop me a tweet with a link to it ðŸ˜Š https://twitter.com/rick_west8
